The UI/ Interface

# Description

The managing misinformation web application we are developing must produce the results of the urls entered that will further present a rating and category of how credible the information is. That information will be analyzed by the web scraping team that will retrieve the topmost relevant articles on the topic of the url the user has entered. Both analytics teams will present us with the categorization of the text and determine the reputation of sources. Our job is to make sure all this information is displayed correctly while making sure we are making the site encrypted, secure using TLS connection, user friendly, and creating that pretty face for the users.
